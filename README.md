# Fibonacci Calculator
A simple web application that uses Node and Express JS and a server together with React as a frontend
and with a simple worker to calculate the fibonacci results
The persistence will be dealt with the use of
- Postgres: as a sql database
- Redis: as a caching driver

All the services will be bundled with Docker.

## Get it running
Just run `docker-compose up --build` to bring up all the containers and run the application
